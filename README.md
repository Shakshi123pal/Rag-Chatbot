# 🤖 RAG Chatbot
I built a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) chatbot that can ingest  PDFs, perform semantic search, and generate context-grounded answers to user questions. I implemented the embedding and similarity retrieval flow, designed the UI using Gradio, and automated deployment using Docker and scripts. This project demonstrates my practical experience with real-world NLP pipelines and model integration.
